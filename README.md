# Storybook Addon: Dependency Tree

## Overview
**Storybook Dependency Tree** is an addon for Storybook that visualizes the dependency hierarchy of each story in a tree view. This tool helps developers understand and navigate the dependencies associated with their stories more efficiently.

## Features
- **Visual Dependency Mapping**: Automatically load and display all dependencies for the currently open story, providing a clear and structured view similar to [storybook-addon-deps](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-deps).
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates seamlessly with Storybook, enhancing your development workflow.

## Dependencies
- **Dependency Loading**: Powered by [node-dependency-tree](https://github.com/dependents/node-dependency-tree) to accurately map and load dependencies.
